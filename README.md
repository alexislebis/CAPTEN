# CAPTEN

Web-based ecosystem concerning the Capitalization of Analysis Processes for Technology Enhanced learNing (CAPTEN).

Developed by **[A.Lebis](http://liris.cnrs.fr/~alebis)** under the **[Hubble project](http://hubblelearn.imag.fr/?lang=fr)** `ANR-14-CE24-0015`.


CAPTEN is a composition of several scientific works:

- Works on semantic creation of independent analysis processes (*IAP*): Semantic descriptor & designer (*SEED*)
- Works on relevant researches and browsing for IAP
- Works on the evolution of the semantic aspect of the e-learning vocabulary & ontology embeded in CAPTEN
- Works on the inferences made in/by an IAP
- Works on the adaptability of an IAP
- Works on the implementation of IAP
- Works on the versioning of IAP/OI

These different works are strongly bound. Indeed, in the elaboration of an IAP in CAPTEN-SEED, the system *MUST* infere information, the CAPTEN vocabularies and ontologies *MUST* evolve according to users,...

## CAPTEN-ONE
This first directory is the test subproject where different elements are developed, involved and tested for further release.

## CAPTEN-SEED

CAPTEN-SEED, standing for *Capitalization of Analysis Processes for Technology Enhanced learNing - SEmantic dEscriptor & Designer*, allow the users to create and describe analysis processes used mainly in the TEL field under an independent formalism, ready for capitalization and sharing.

This formalism is based on relational vocabularies and ontologies.

### Documentation
See tutorials and examples for using CAPTEN-SEED for more information.

### Install
